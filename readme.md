# Python Projects Repository

This repository showcases my Python projects, focusing on data manipulation and analysis using the pandas library.

## Project List

### 1. Data Cleaning Project
- **Objective**: Transform raw data into a clean and standardized format.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Removed duplicates and missing values.
  - Standardized column names.
  - Applied string operations to ensure data consistency.
- **Outcome**: The cleaned data was prepared for further analysis with a consistent and structured format.

## 2.Customer Churn Analysis Project  

This project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract actionable insights from a customer churn dataset and present findings through clear visualizations. By analyzing key factors influencing customer retention and churn, we identify trends, patterns, and correlations that impact business decisions. The project includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, and interactive visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to effectively communicate insights and drive strategic improvements.
