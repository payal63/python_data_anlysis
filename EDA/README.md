# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue using a service or product. Understanding the reasons behind churn and identifying key patterns is essential for businesses to design strategies that enhance customer retention. This project utilizes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract actionable insights from a customer churn dataset and present findings through clear visualizations.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze churn patterns and contributing factors.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Communicate insights effectively using visualizations.
- Deliver actionable recommendations to reduce customer attrition.

## Highlights
- **Churn Rate**: Approximately **26%** of customers have churned.
- **Senior Citizens**: Higher churn rate compared to non-senior customers.
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn risk.
- **Gender Analysis**: Minimal impact of gender on churn behavior.

### Visual Insights
- **Churn by Senior Citizens**: Stacked bar charts reveal churn proportions, with percentages labeled for clarity.
- **Contract Types**: Pie and bar charts highlight the higher churn rates for short-term contracts.

## Tools and Libraries
- **`pandas`**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **`seaborn`**: To create insightful and visually appealing charts.
- **`matplotlib`**: For detailed chart customizations.

This concise EDA transforms raw data into actionable insights, providing businesses with the necessary tools to address churn effectively and improve customer retention strategies.
